abstract: 'Modern fabrication methods have greatly simplified manufacturing of complex
  free-form shapes at an affordable cost, and opened up new possibilities for improving
  functionality and customization through automatic optimization, shape optimization
  in particular. However, most existing shape optimization methods focus on single
  parts. In this work, we focus on supporting shape optimization for assemblies, more
  specifically, assemblies that are held together by contact and friction. Examples
  of which include furniture joints, construction set assemblies, certain types of
  prosthetic devices and many other. To enable this optimization, we present a framework
  supporting robust and accurate optimization of a number of important functionals,
  while enforcing constraints essential for assembly functionality: weight, stress,
  difficulty of putting the assembly together, and how reliably it stays together.
  Our framework is based on smoothed formulation of elasticity equations with contact,
  analytically derived shape derivatives, and robust remeshing to enable large changes
  of shape, and at the same time, maintain accuracy. We demonstrate the improvements
  it can achieve for a number of computational and experimental examples.'
