abstract: 'In this video, we illustrate how one of the classical areas of computational
  geometry has gained in practical relevance, which in turn gives rise to new, fascinating
  geometric problems. In particular, we demonstrate how the robot platform IRMA3D
  can produce high-resolution, virtual 3D environments, based on a limited number
  of laser scans. Computing an optimal set of scans amounts to solving an instance
  of the Art Gallery Problem (AGP): Place a minimum number of stationary guards in
  a polygonal region P, such that all points in P are guarded.'
