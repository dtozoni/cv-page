My name is Davi Colli Tozoni and I'm a PhD Candidate in Computer Science working with Prof. Denis Zorin in the [Geometry Computing Lab](https://cims.nyu.edu/gcl/) at **New York University**. I had experiences both in academia and in the industry, and I strongly appreciate working in projects mixing theory and practice.
My main interest is in Computer Graphics, especially in Simulations, Optimization, Microstructures, Digital Fabrication and Soft Robotics.
I'm also very interested in problems involving Computational Geometry and Combinatorial Optimization, like the Art Gallery Problem.

Here is a short description of my main projects:
<font size="3">
- **Soft Robotics Optimization:** designed computational framework for optimizing shape, material properties and initial configuration of soft robots. Our model, which includes contact and friction forces, allows for realistic simulation of dynamic elastic problems
- **Contact-based assemblies Optimization:** developed algorithm and code that optimizes shape of multi-piece objects aiming to reduce stress concentrations, while keeping pieces easy to assemble. Optimized objects can be more than 10x stronger, verified both in simulations and 3D-printed physical experiments
- **Microstructure Mapping and Optimization:** designed technique to smoothly map material properties to microstructure geometry, which allows us to build compliant 3D-printable objects using a single material from curved and non-regular quad meshes. Our technique was compared to other state-of-the-art techniques, showing significant better results
- **Solving the Art Gallery Problem:** developed new algorithm and software solution in C++ for optimally solving the Art Gallery Problem (AGP). The new algorithm is able to find guaranteed optimal solutions for instances of thousands of vertices in a matter of minutes, something not possible before, when algorithms had issues with polygons of dozens of vertices.
