abstract: 'In this paper, we study an instance of the G-closure problem for two-dimensional
  periodic metamaterials. Specifically, we consider composites with isotropic homogenized
  elasticity tensor, obtained as a mixture of two isotropic materials. We focus on
  the case when one material has zero stiffness, i.e., single-material structures
  with voids. This problem is important, in particular, in the context of designing
  small-scale structures for metamaterials that can be manufactured using additive
  fabrication. A range of effective metamaterial properties can be obtained this way
  using a single base material. We demonstrate that two closely related simple parametric
  families based on the structure proposed by Sigmund in [26] attain good coverage
  of the space of isotropic properties satisfying Hashin–Shtrikman bounds. In particular,
  for positive Poisson’s ratio, we demonstrate that Hashin–Shtrikman bound can be
  approximated arbitrarily well, within limits imposed by numerical approximation:
  a strong evidence that these bounds are achievable in this case. For negative Poisson’s
  ratios, we numerically obtain a bound which we hypothesize to be close to optimal,
  at least for metamaterials with rotational symmetries of a regular triangle tiling.'
