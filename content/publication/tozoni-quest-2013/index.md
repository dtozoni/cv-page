abstract: The general Art Gallery Problem (AGP) consists in finding the minimum number
  of guards sufficient to ensure the visibility coverage of an art gallery represented
  by a polygon. The AGP is a well known ℕℙNPmathbbNP-hard problem and, for this reason,
  all algorithms proposed so far to solve it are unable to guarantee optimality except
  in special cases. In this paper, we present a new method for solving the Art Gallery
  Problem by iteratively generating upper and lower bounds while seeking to reach
  an exact solution. Notwithstanding that convergence remains an important open question,
  our algorithm has been successfully tested on a very large collection of instances
  from publicly available benchmarks. Tests were carried out for several classes of
  instances totalizing more than a thousand hole-free polygons with sizes ranging
  from 20 to 1000 vertices. The proposed algorithm showed a remarkable performance,
  obtaining provably optimal solutions for every instance in a matter of minutes on
  a standard desktop computer. To our knowledge, despite the AGP having been studied
  for four decades within the field of computational geometry, this is the first time
  that an exact algorithm is proposed and extensively tested for this problem. Future
  research directions to expand the present work are also discussed.
