abstract: The Art Gallery Problem (AGP) is one of the most well-known problems in
  Computational Geometry (CG), with a rich history in the study of algorithms, complexity,
  and variants. Recently there has been a surge in experimental work on the problem.
  In this survey, we describe this work, show the chronology of developments, and
  compare current algorithms, including two unpublished versions, in an exhaustive
  experiment. Furthermore, we show what core algorithmic ingredients have led to recent
  successes.
